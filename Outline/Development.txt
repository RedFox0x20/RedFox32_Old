Development
===========

Understanding the development environment
- File structure
	- Documentation: Contains final documentation regarding OS operation and
	  design. This may include documentation such as guides for writing an OS,
	  the stages involved and other items such as driver implementation methods.

	- Img: Contain reference images for markdown documents in addition to images
	  of the system in operation.

	- Outline: Contains research documents and notes for future reference.
	
	- RedFox32: Contains the primary components of the OS
		- Source: All OS source code will be contained here
		
		- LinkerScripts: To build binary files some changes need making during
		  the linker stage, where necessary a linker script can be made and
		  stored here
		
		- Old: This directory should be removed eventually once the outdated
		  material is no longer relevant.
		
		* DiskBuilder.sh: A generic script that makes producing the final floppy
		  image just that little bit easier.

		* Makefile: The make build system is used within the project. The
		  Makefile contains all the rules associated with efficiently building
		  the OS.
