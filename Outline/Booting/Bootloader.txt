BOOTLOADER
==========

The bootloader will consist of two stages, the Initial Loading Stage and the
Setup Stage.

Initial Loading Stage (ILS)
===========================
The ILS resides within the first sector of the Floppy Drive. This is loaded by
the system BIOS to 0x7C00:0x0000.

The ILS will load the second stage which is used for switching from Real Mode to
Protected Mode. This will be performed using the BIOS functions available to us.

Setup Stage
===========
The Setup Stage will be completely loaded by the ILS stage, it will use further
BIOS functions to provide I/O in addition to pre-determined system structures
that will be used for defining system operation. Once the system has been
prepared for Protected Mode Operation we can switch and hand over control to the
Kernel which should perform features such as further hardware control (Drivers)
and provide a core feature-list which can be extended to create user software.

Once we have entered Protected Mode we can use the C programming language.
Everything before this point MUST be done in Assembly.
