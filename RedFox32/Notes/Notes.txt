FDC -> In a monotasking environment (Such as the one we have) it is reccomended
to use PIO mode rather than Interrupts.

Despite this I will use Interrupts as it is likely that in the future once a
monotasking environment has been produced a multitasking environment can be
implemented. Until that point it's considered a waste of cycles however it
ultimately isn't going to be that big of an issue!
