# Contributing
RedFox32 is a self learning exercise, and as such I want to ensure that all source is written by myself, for myself and tested primarily to work on my hardware.
To contribute to the project please don't make any changes to the source code, only report errors to me and I will do the learning to fix them!
If you have your own hardware to test the project on, please do, I only guaruntee the project to run on QEMU and a Clevo 2200C.

[0] In regards to hardware, if the hardware is common I will consider reading into what may be different about it and potentially learn to develop for it, however, the purpose is to provide open learning resources to anyone with an interest in this type of project, so please feel free to fork the project and learn to develop the missing features for your device on the foundation I have provided!

[1] You may suggest areas where efficiency could be improved, however again, please no direct code suggstions, suggest other algorithms or give me a nudge as to where I might have a bottleneck.
