PROJECT MAP
===========

ToDo:
	Floppy Driver
	File system (Dependant on ^)
	Binary file execution (Dependant on ^)*
	Portable Executables (Dependant on ^)*
		- ELF
		- PE
		- Do some research
	
	* The idea of seperating "Kernel space" and "User space" applications
	  through the "ring" system may be worth looking in to, ultimately it is not
	  a necessity with the project however it would be a good idea to look at
	  for the creation of full and thorough documation.

If desired ToDos:
	Further graphics:
		- VGA Driver
		- VESA Driver
	Shutdown
		- ACPI
			- RSDP
			- RSDT
			- FADT
	Reboot
		- ACPI
		- OR Triple fault with a 0x0000:0x0000 ? Need to readup on this.

InProgress:
	Keyboard Driver (Further Interrupts & Syscalls)
		- Provides the basics of input and looks at implementing an "Event"
		  based reading system. This could work however needs review and
		  research.
	Text Mode Driver
		- Output only
		- Waiting on keyboard driver

Done:
	Bootloader Stage 1
	Bootloader Stage 2
	System setup
		- Protected Mode
